\section{Refraction networking introduction}

Refraction networking (RN) is a scheme for evading censorship technology, such as website blacklists enforced by governments, with the help of an ISP partner. Specifically, in refraction networking (also called ``decoy routing''), the user requests a blocked site, but the RN protocol actually requests a reachable site with some encrypted header information. The censor accepts the request that seems to be legitimate, but the ISP partner reads the header information and ``refracts'' the request to the blocked site that the user originally requested.

The specific RN protocol we will reimplement for our project is TapDance \cite{tapdance}.
